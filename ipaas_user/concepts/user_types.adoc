=== {prodname} User Types

Several different kinds of users interact with {prodname}. These user groups 
include:

* *End users* create integrations in the {prodname} console, and then deploy
and monitor those integrations in the {prodname} dashboard. 
End users do not write code to create
integrations. These users, sometimes referred to as citizen users,
