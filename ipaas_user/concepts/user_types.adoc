=== IPaaS User Types

Several different kinds of users interact with iPaaS. These user groups 
include:

* *End users* create integrations in the iPaaS console, and then deploy
and monitor those integrations in the iPaaS dashboard. 
End users do not write code to create
integrations. These users, sometimes referred to as citizen users,
 understand the business requirements and how to 
achieve them by integrating different applications. End users do not need
to understand how the integration works. 

* *Expert users* create iPaaS connections from iPaaS-provided connectors.
They can also develop additional iPaaS connectors. Expert users are
experienced programmers. 

* *Developers* are programmers who contribute to the iPaaS code base. 

* *Administrators* deploy iPaaS, manage iPaaS users and monitor iPaaS
operation. 

* *Contributors* add to the open source code base.
