=== Definitions of IPaaS Terms

IPaaS lets you enable data transfer between different applications. For example,
each time a customer is mentioned in Twitter, you might want to capture that
mention in that customerâ€™s Salesforce account.

To set up data transfer between applications, you create an integration. When
you create an integration you identify the source application and the target
application by selecting from the set of iPaaS-provided connectors.

A connector represents a specific application that you want to obtain data from
or send data to. For example, iPaaS provides a Twitter connector, a Salesforce
connector, a MongoDB connector. Each connector is a template for defining a
connection to that application. In other words, the Twitter connector is a
template for defining a connection to Twitter.

In iPaaS, a connection is a configured connector.

In any number of integrations, you can select the same connector. For example,
in integration A you can select the Twitter connector to create a connection
that uses a particular set of configuration details to connect to Twitter. In
integration B, you can select that same Twitter connector but specify a
different set of configuration details and so create a different connection to
Twitter.
