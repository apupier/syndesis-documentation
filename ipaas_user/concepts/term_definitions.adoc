=== Understanding IPaaS Terms

IPaaS lets you enable data transfer between different applications. For example,
each time a customer is mentioned in Twitter, you might want to capture that
mention in that customerâ€™s Salesforce account. Another example is a service 
that makes stock trade recommendations. You can capture recommendations of interest
and forward them to a service that automates stock transfers. 

==== Integration

To set up data transfer between applications, you create an integration. When
you create an integration you identify the source application and the target
application by selecting from a set of connections.

==== Connection

A connection represents a specific application that you want to obtain data from
or send data to. For example, the set of connections you can choose from might  
include a Twitter connection, a Salesforce connection, a Gmail connection, and so on. 
Each connection has been created and configured by someone in your organization.

In any number of integrations, you can select the same connection. For example,
in integration A you can select the Twitter connection and configure it to 
use `JDoe` as the Twitter screen name. In
integration B, you can select that same Twitter connection and configure it
to use `KLee` as the Twitter screen name. 

==== Action 

In an integration, each connection performs an action. For some
connections, you choose the action. Other connections can perform
only one action and you are not offered a choice when you create
an integration that uses that connection. For example, when you create
an integration that uses a Salesforce connection the possible
actions include creating a Salesforce account, updating a Salesforce
account, searching Salesforce, and more. 

==== Step

In some integrations, obtaining data from one application and 
using it in another application is all you want to do. But in other
integrations, you might need a step between the data's
source and target applications. Steps you can add include logging,
filtering out data, spliting data, and more.
