[[Choose-Finish-Connection]]
= Choose the Finish Connection

To add the finish connection to the integration:

. On the *Choose a Finish Connection* page, click *Salesforce Connection 1*. 
This integration finishes by using the credentials 
defined in *Salesforce Connection 1* to 
connect to Salesforce. 
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Create/Update Contact*.
. On the next page accept *TwitterScreenName_c* as the
Salesforce object ID name. 
. Click *Done* to add the finish connection to the integration. 

The *TwitterScreenName_c* field is a custom field that the integration
uses to determine
whether creation of a new Salesforce contact is required. 
If a Salesforce contact
with this ID already exists then the integration updates that contact. 
Otherwise, the integration creates a new contact.
