== {prodname} Tutorials

IMPORTANT: This is a work in progress that is not ready for review. The 
audience for the tutorials is the citizen user who is completely new to
{prodname} in the preview release. The purpose of the tutorials now
(July 2017) is to capture information we know and also show how much
information we need to provide to ensure successful implementation of 
the sample scenarios. 

{prodname} tutorials provide instructions for implementing
sample integrations:

* <<Twitter-to-Salesforce>>
* <<Salesforce-to-DB>>
* <<Three-APIs>>

You can create these sample integrations in any order.
