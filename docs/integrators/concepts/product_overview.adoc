=== Introducing {prodname} 

{prodname} is a platform that provides integration 
capabilities as a service. With {prodname}, you can obtain data from an
application or service, operate on that data if you need to, and then 
send the 
data to a completely different application or service.  No coding is 
required to accomplish this. 

==== What It Does
{prodname} lets you connect to any application or service that your business uses. 
Connectors provided with {prodname} function as templates for defining connections 
to applications and services. For example, {prodname} provides a Salesforce connector 
for creating connections to Salesforce installations. 

==== How It Works

Connectors form the foundation of {prodname}. Each connector
is an Apache Camel component with added metadata that
enables the intuitive {prodname} interface. This metadata
specifies:

* Some connection settings

* Actions that can be performed and their
properties and defaults

* What the input data and output data look like

Each connector

* Has a single purpose, for example, connect to a 
Salesforce application

* Hides component properties that are not relevant to that purpose

When an integration of different applications is ready to be deployed:

. {prodname} creates a Spring Boot-based Camel project and a 
build configuration.

. Triggers the build, which produces a container image.

. Starts running the container image on OpenShift.

In addition, {prodname} stores your integrationâ€™s implementation 
source code and configuration in a source control management system,
such as GitHub. This enables you to look at it, change it and 
include it as a part of your DevOps pipeline. 

==== How You Use It

How you use {prodname} depends on whether you are integrating 
applications, creating connections for particular applications
or services, or developing new connectors. 

{prodname} provides a web browser interface that lets anyone integrate 
two different applications 
or services. No coding is required regardless of the complexity of the 
integration. To deploy a simple integration, the main steps are to select a 
connection for the source application, select a connection for the destination 
application, respond to any prompts for configuration settings, 
and give the 
integration a name. You can then save the integration or immediately
deploy it.

The {prodname} dashboard lets you monitor and manage integrations. You can see 
which integrations are running, start and stop integrations, edit and remove 
integrations. 

There is also a web browser interface for creating connections. You
select the connector for the application or service you want to
connect to.  {prodname} prompts you to
enter values for the parameters required to create the connection.
You then verify that the connection works before making it available
to be used in integrations. 

There are {prodname} APIs for creating additional connectors.

==== Benefits

The benefits of {prodname} include:

* No coding required to share data between different applications or 
services.

* Deploy on the public cloud, a private cloud, or on-premise.

* Run {prodname} on OpenShift or Kubernetes. 

* Connectors are based on Apache Camel components. If {prodname} does
not provide a 
connector for an application or service you want to integrate then a 
developer can create the connector you need. 

* All the benefits of open source software. You can extend features,
customize interfaces or connectors, and create additional connectors.
