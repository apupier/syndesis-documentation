= Prerequisites for Implementing Twitter to Salesforce Integration

To implement a Twitter to Salesforce sample integration,
you must have the following:

* Access to two or more Twitter accounts:
** The sample integration watches for tweets that mention a particular
screen name. You need a Twitter account that uses this screen name.
** To see that the integration is working, you need to send tweets from 
two or more Twitter accounts that use other screen names.

* A Salesforce account that is used for development and that contains
dummy contacts. 

* A Salesforce contact for at least one of the Twitter account users. 
This lets you confirm that the integration updates a contact 
you already have.
