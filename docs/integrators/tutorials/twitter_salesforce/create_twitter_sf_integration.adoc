= Create a Twitter to Salesforce Integration

To create an integration that uses the Twitter and Salesforce connections
you just created:

. In the upper right, click *Create Integration*. 
. Select *My First Twitter Connection* to start the integration. 
. Select *Twitter Mention* as the connection’s action.
. Select the *My First Salesforce Connection* as the end destination 
of the integration.
. Select *Create/Update Contact* as the connection’s action. 
. Add a filter step that checks for particular content and continues 
the integration only if that content is present:
.. Click *Add a step*.
.. Select *Basic Filter*. 
.. In the first field, accept the *StatusText* default, which contains
the text of the tweet. This filter checks the content in
the *StatusText* field. 
.. Accept *Contains* as the condition to be met for the integration to
continue. 
.. In the last field, enter `*brilliant*`. A tweet must contain the word 
"brilliant" for the integration to continue operating on this data.
.. Click *Next* to complete the filter step.
. Add a data mapping step that correlates data from Twitter with 
Salesforce contact fields:
.. Click *Add a Step*.
.. Select *Data Mapping*.
.. On the left, select the Twitter 1 field and drag it to the
Salesforce A field. 
.. Select the Twitter 2 field and drag it to the Salesforce B field to 
complete data mapping.
.. Click *Next*.

Click *Save*.
