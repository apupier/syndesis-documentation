= Monitor and Manage Twitter to Salesforce Integration

To monitor and manage the Twitter to Salesforce integration:

. In the left pane, click *Dashboard* to see that  
*Twitter to Salesforce Sample* is an *Active* integration, 
which means that it is running. 
. In Twitter, use two or more accounts to send tweets that 
mention the screen name 
you specified when you created the integration. Some tweets,
but not all tweets, should contain the word "brilliant".
. In Salesforce:
** Check whether the integration created a new
contact.
** Check whether the integration updated an
existing contact. 
** Confirm that tweets that did not contain "brilliant" neither
updated nor created a contact. 
. In the {prodname} dashboard, select the 
*Twitter to Salesforce Sample* and click the three vertical
dots to the right. 
. Select *Deactivate* to stop running the integration. At any time,
you can click the vertical dots and select *Activate*. 
. After testing the integration, select it in the dashboard, click
the three vertical dots and select *Delete*. In this release, only
one active integration is allowed.
