= Create a Twitter Connection

A {prodname} connection to Twitter requires registration of
{prodname} as an application that can access Twitter.
If you did not already register {prodname} for access to
Twitter, see <<Register-With-Twitter>>. 

After registration for {prodname} to access Twitter is in place, follow
these steps to create a Twitter connection:

. In the left pane, click *Connections* to display available connections. 
Initially, there are no connections. 
. In the upper right corner, click *Create Connection* to display
{prodname} connectors. You use the Twitter connector to create a 
Twitter connection.
. In the *Name* field, enter `*Twitter*`.
. Select the *Twitter* connector. With registration in place, the
*Twitter* connector needs no additional configuration to create a
Twitter connection.
. In the upper right, click *Next*. 
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter `*My First Twitter Connection*`.
. In the upper right, click *Create*. This displays 
*My First Twitter Connection* as an available connection.
