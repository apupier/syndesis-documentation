= Create a Salesforce Connection

A {prodname} connection to Salesforce requires registration of
{prodname} as an application that can access Salesforce.
If you did not already register {prodname} for access to 
Salesforce, see <<Register-With-Salesforce>>. 

To create a Salesforce connection:

. In the left pane, click *Connections* to display available connections. 
. In the upper right, click *Create Connection* to display
{prodname} connection types. 
. Click the *Salesforce* connection type. 
. Click *Connect Salesforce* to display a Salesforce authorization page. 
. Click *Authorize App* to return to {prodname}.
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter `*Salesforce Connection 1*`.
. In the upper right, click *Create* to see that 
*Salesforce Connection 1* is now an available connection. 

The next step is to <<Create-Twitter-SF-Integration>>.
