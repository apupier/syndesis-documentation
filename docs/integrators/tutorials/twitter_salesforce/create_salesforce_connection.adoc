= Create a Salesforce Connection

A {prodname} connection to Salesforce requires registration of
{prodname} as an application that can access Salesforce.
If you did not already register {prodname} for access to 
Salesforce, see <<Register-With-Salesforce>>. 

After registration for {prodname} to access Salesforce is in place, follow
these steps to create a Salesforce connection:

. In the left pane, click *Connections* to display available connections. 
. In the upper right, click *Create Connection* to display
{prodname} connectors. You use the Salesforce connector to create a 
Salesforce connection.
. In the *Name* field, enter `*Salesforce*`.
. Select the *Salesforce* connector.  
. In the *Consumer Name* field, enter your Salesforce user name.
. In the *Consumer Secret* field, enter your Salesforce password.
. Click *Validate* to confirm that {prodname} is authorized to 
access your Salesforce account.
. After successful validation, click *Next*. 
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter `*My First Salesforce Connection*`.
. In the upper right, click *Create*. This displays 
*My First Salesforce Connection* as an available connection.
