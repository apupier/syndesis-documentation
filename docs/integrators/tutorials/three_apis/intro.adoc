[[Three-APIs]]
= Implement a Sample Integration of Three APIs

This sample integration obtains data through an API, 
uses that data to obtain additional data through a second API 
and then uses the combined data to perform an action through 
a third API. 

Before you implement this integration, see <<Three-API-Prerequisites>>. 

To implement the three-API sample integration, the main steps are:


. <<Create-API1-Connection>>. 
. <<Create-API2-Connection>>. 
. <<Create-API3-Connection>>.
. <<Create-3API-Integration>>.
. <<Deploy-3API-Integration>>.
. <<Monitor-Manage-3API-Integration>>.
